# Building and Deploying a Traffic Sign Detection System Using CNN

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning and computer vision to automatically detect and recognize traffic signs, aiding technologies like self-driving cars. It combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a React-based web application for practical deployment.

## Features
- **Accuracy:** Test Accuracy: 91.56%, Recall: 91.56%, F1 Score: 91.67%.
- **Frontend:** Built with React and Tailwind for user-friendly image upload and prediction display.
- **Backend:** FastAPI for efficient communication with the trained model.

## Tools & Libraries
- **CNNs, PyTorch:** For training the model.
- **OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib:** For image processing and result visualization.
- **scikit-learn:** For performance evaluation.
